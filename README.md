## Simple Description About Project

In this project created a machine learning model to identify various kinds of skin diseases. The following are skin diseases that this model can identify.

- Acne And Rosacea
- Bullous Disease
- Eczema
- Melanoma Skin
- Cancer Nevi And Moles
- Scabies Lyme
- Disease And Other Infestations And Bites
- Tinea Ringworm
- Candidiasis And Other Fungal Infections
- Urticaria Hives
- Vascular Tumors
- Vasculitis
- Warts Molluscum And Other Viral Infections

## Infrastructure for Built Model

### Libraries

Model Machine Learning for Aksacarma built with Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab. This Jupyter Notebook also can run in local. For development, the following are libraries which needs to be installed.

```
tensorflow==2.12.0
keras==2.12.0

opendatasets==0.1.22
matplotlib==3.7.1
numpy==1.22.4
```

### Dataset

The data used to build this model was obtained from Kagle, that is [Dermnet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamgoel27/dermnet). This data is merged and re-sorted according to the needs of the training model. The latest data used is available here.
